Documentations for Data-Caster Tools

> Note about deployment this documentation on GitHub Pages.
> When you are using `GIT_USER=<GIT_USER> npm run publish-gh-pages`
> you need to have global git settings for user name and e-mail:
> ```shell script
> git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
> git config --global user.name "Your Name"
> ``` 
> This is mandatory because of internal folder `<PROJECT_NAME>-<DEVELOPMENT-BRANCH>`
> has its own git config and doesn't allow you to use config from this local repo.
